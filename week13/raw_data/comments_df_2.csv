So incredibly happy for you two. The nursery looks like a dream come true and can't wait for little girl to arrive! Wishing you a speedy and healthy delivery Zoe and Alfie!

If I had any advice to give, this one stuck out to me from my sister when she had my nephew: Internet mama's can be horrendous. They'll constantly be telling you what you're doing wrong and point it out 24/7 which can be upsetting especially with post pregnancy hormones raging. Listen to your body and baby and know you're doing things right and you are trying your hardest because you know your baby best! Obviously you're used to internet trolls but don't let any internet mama bears get in the way of this amazing chapter in yours and Alfie's lives! ❤️ Much love from California! xo",2,0

That's to adorable. OH ZOË  make room for CHRISTMASDRESSES 🥰🥰❤ ❤. Maybe a fun idea to Ask a pictures from everyone in the family and place them on the pinboard. Such as pictures from grandmother and grandfathers and uncles and aunt's. And Guncles such as Mark and Joey . So you can make a ritual with "" goodnight "" so she learns the faces with the names. ( I did that with my son) . Basicly you are learning them not only the names and faces. But also.. "" oh he or she is on my wall so I can trust that person"" . I cant wait to see photos from her. But I do understand it if you would say "" I wanne keep her face private "" . Ohw this is so excited 😊 🤗  enjoy your last few days with Alfie. 😘 BTW you look so beautifull pregnant.

LthPuLsLzm8,UCreYdeoosep_8T7gCszYnyg,nene0003,2021-08-25 15:49:00,"Discussing parenthood: The best thing that me and my husband ever did for our kids was the fact that we never had ANYthing that was only mom's job (other than breastfeeding and giving birth).  Seriously, I was dead serious about not being the only one who knows where thing are, the only one who is able to buy clothes, the only one who can sort stuff like in with the new out with the old, the only one who communicates with school, everything! This is the best parenting advice I can possibly give: please do it all, do it together, and never have clear set specific roles that a man is supposed to do or what the woman is supposed to do. It gives you way wider perspective and way more freedom to be you and figure things out for your specific needs in your family. My husband is a way better father and I am a way better mother for this reason! <3 I LOVE SEEING how you are both very involved. I can see that you both are going to be amazing parents! So always - you do you - definitely! And after giving advice: my final and best advice: don't take anybody's advice, haha. But seriously, you are smart and loving and that is enough to make you be completely able and the absolutely best and only people who will know how to raise your kid and how to be parents. Don't let internet mess with your head, don't let anybody increase your mom-guilt and dad-guilt even a tiniest bit. As long as you are there for your kid you are going to be fine. SO so so  much love to your incredibly cute family! <3",7612,0

I literally didn't show much at all, I didn't need maternity clothes and to the point the midwife was sending me to the hospital for scans every week as she was worried the baby wasn't growing, as the measurements of my bump were far too low for the weeks. My baby turned out to be 7lb14 so she grew as normal, but all the midwives were shocked as my stomach muscles kept her all inside. Everything was squashed and my ribs suffered those weird sensations during the second trimester, which one midwife suggested might be the cartilage and muscles being stretched. By the third trimester she kept putting something between a rib and caused me agony until I could push her a bit to get her to move.",0,0

I’m in America and always have loved watching you for a breath of fresh air for years now ☺️ I’m actually currently getting that rib pain and odd feeling you described! It feels like something kinda fluttering near my ribs occasionally, and I’ve been told it most likely is the first sign of movement from the baby! It’s right near my ribs too, but I’m quite tall at 5’10” so I think that may have been what that is for me! It might have been for you too but no one could figure it out because it’s hard to describe like you said.

I always found high salty food would take the feeling off for me. 
Mine started during the huge heatwave we had. Every time I got too hot (whilst wearing my face mask) I’d feel suddenly like I was going to faint. But luckily never did. One was in the middle of my friends wedding ceremony. Other times it’s been in shops when I feel like my mask won’t let me breathe. 

Really scary situation to be in! Especially because you feel silly just having a lay down on a shop floor randomly. I used to hurry back to the car and sit with the air con blasting until it regulated again xxx",0,0

6XMYsw5CLvM,UCTvuibHQN6eZrkzOZxM1Nng,Tasha Ormiston,2021-08-23 15:56:06,I’m a FTM with a 15 day old and honestly apart from feeding and safe sleeping not much else matters in terms of research because everyone’s child is so different! It’s better learning as you go so that you can meet your child’s individual needs I think. So excited to see yours and Alfie’s journey start with the little one. It’s an unbelievable feeling. My 1 bit of advice is don’t put pressure on a routine or “getting back to normal” as the weeks go on. We did this and we already feel like the baby bubble feeling has gone and I would do anything to have that back just for one day. Just stop and soak it all in for as long as you can 💗,0,0

I was the same with my first trimester of feeling nauseous up till week 16 then it disappeared. The best feeling is getting your appetite back when baby is born. The water retention will soon go once baby keeps you guys active😅 . I can relate to the rib cage and organ pushing in 3rd trimester too also been petite body and my daugther was 7Lbs 😳 but it was all worth it. I can see you and alfie been great parents.

Going through a rough time at the moment. My favourite creators on YouTube has always been able to help me through hard times. So thank you for inviting us on this journey ♥️

Even though I’m still on the journey to conceive I have a name 🙈 for a boy and one for a girl. Pretty much set in stone. But I could change my mind as I hold and have a first look at my child. So I don’t want anyone to know the names. And I don’t want anyone to steal them. It does happen and my names are not rare or strange… just not typical Swedish names. 

And yes… as a first daughter of 2 girls to my parents. I came out as a copy of my father. 
I’m prepared for this as well. My child might look allot like my donor. The donor is a great person. Intelligent, kind and has appealing features 🤗

I’m fearful of a positiv just as much as I am if a negative. Because I’ve already lost one pregnancy. It was early but still hurt. I was pregnant over mother’s day this year. And now the second try after failed 🥺 life is full of uphill battles. 

Has anyone been through the same journey with insiminations?",1,0

For your baby’s name, go sit at the beach or in a store and imagine calling for your child out loud. Also listen to how other names sound when other parents call for their children. It’s incredible how some names sound different in public. 

Use your potential baby name as your Starbucks order name, or for your dinner reservation. Hear how it will sound for them in the future.

Don’t wash all of your baby clothes before it’s born. You may give birth to a larger baby and skip newborn clothes completely. Wash them as you go. That way you can return or exchange them for a different size :)",336,0

When I was pregnant with my little boy I wanted everything ready snd I tried so hard to get it all together but in the end I was actually no where near ready when he was born 4 weeks early snd when we came back from the hospital, nothing was ready as my partner had food poisoning at the same time as me given birth so we was both hit was a wave of stress, exhaustion and just utter disorganisation haha I’ve only just got round to pretty much finishing my little ones room and he’s 4/5 months now! But like you said the baby only cares for you! As long as you have fresh clothes, a clean bed and lots of love everything else is just an added bonus! Congratulations on your brilliant mummy news!

I've not been cautious. I worked the drive thru at taco Bell during lockdown last year. I've now worked at Walmart for almost a year. So, I've always been ""essential"" and never experienced the lock down situation that everyone else has. I've not gotten sick and never needed to get tested for covid. My personal opinion is that the best way to get through this is to naturally let our bodies adjust to it.  Learn how to fight the virus on its own. I also do not trust any vaccines being pushed on everyone. Besides the fact that they are not fully affective against the virus nor variants.... New variants will continue to arise. The vaccines will later be blamed for side effects.",2,0

I also loved paddington and the knickerbocker rainbow when he and the browns go to the beach despite bad weather. paddington is worried about the tide coming in so puts his armbands on. they go into a cafe to stay dry and paddington is bought a knickerbocker glory and then the sun comes out and paddington see's a rainbow just like the colors in his knickerbocker glory.  it's a brilliant book I'd highly recommend and it's 3.99 with free postage on amazon.!",0,0
