I found the person I want to be with forever,  and we're committed to each other long term. We've gone through thick and thin and are growing together.  However, I don't want to get married as I don't want to support the history of how marriages came about,  and a myriad of other things leading to getting married (generally man proposes instead of the woman, asking permission from in laws etc etc). I think modern marriages appear to be solely a commitment to each other,  and if that's already there,  then there is no more need to get married.  :)",0,0

One thing I want to add to the question about marriage you might not have considered! I think you‚Äôre operating under the assumption that people who don‚Äôt get married switch partners and typically aren‚Äôt committed to one person, which in my experience isn‚Äôt the case at all! The reason a lot of people don‚Äôt get married is exactly what you said in the beginning, it has a lot of antiquated origins, but the biggest aspect I think is that people feel like they can have everything a married couple has without the institution of marriage! I definitely think that‚Äôs the case from an emotional and romantic point of view, but from a legal perspective I‚Äôm still undecided. 

For anyone reading this and asking themselves the same question: marriage doesn‚Äôt have to be a romantic or emotional choice and honestly I don‚Äôt think it should be! It can absolutely be just like any other contract you sign. Here are some things you might not have considered about marriage that might help you: Will you be allowed to make medical decisions for your partner? Will you even be allowed in the hospital room outside of visiting hours? How does having kids factor into your decision? Shared finances? Shared businesses? How would it affect home ownership? What about debt? 

I really like the idea of prenups for everyone, not just wealthy people. Divorces are long and messy but with prenups you can set the terms of your marriage + a potential divorce in an official capacity and it can include literally whatever you both want it to include. Depending on what country you get married in and where you‚Äôre filing for divorce, certain laws can really screw you over. After a divorce, can you still be held responsible for debt your spouse created while you were married? 

These are all incredibly important things to consider when you want to decide whether marriage is right for your relationship. You might‚Äôve married your last long term partner if it had worked out between you, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to feel the same way about every long term partner. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not committed to the person.",0,0

I dated two people recently, the first person I wanted to date but my friends made it known at every opportunity that they hated him. They'd roll their eyes and refuse to even acknowledge him and all the tension resulted in the end of the relationship. The second one started and was fueled by the fact that he was within our friend group, so they took every opportunity to let me know hw much we should be together etc and yet I wasn't really into it. So obviously after my initial 'honeymoon' phase wore off (pretty quickly might I add) I just didn't want to be doing it anymore.

You'd have to have had OCD your whole life as it's biological, but OCD can be milder and something at some point in your life triggers it to a moderate to severe. OCD isn't just about cleaning and contamination, it can be about any subject. There are compulsions that are mental such as rumination, mental review, checking, neutralizing thoughts. It's different from anxiety in the way the intrusive thoughts just *stick* and are accompanied by *compulsive* debilitating physical or mental behaviors and so many feelings such as guilt feel so loud and unwavering. Just thought I'd share, in case anyone struggles with symptoms, as OCD is so overlooked and misunderstood!",0,0

Because we are humans and not animals, we have to control that if basically we do not have mental issues ^^
My post parthum was hard because i was always tired and hungry and i was fighting against that. Also hearing a baby yelling was very hard for me because I am a person who laughs a lot and hates bad vibes. But I found a way to be not affected by baby yellings :) 
I just stop saying he is yelling at me but  saying something to me and I directly charge my positive battery :)

I struggle with anxiety and OCD and have done for many years... when not pregnant I have it pretty much under control and have a great life, I've learned to live with my thoughts (more or less, some days are easier than others :-) ). When pregnant however I'm a total hormonal mess and have no power over anything really. With my youngest I would say it took me about 4-6 month after giving birth to feel like myself and for my hormones to settle. It's so tough but remember that it will pass - hormones are just hormones :-) Lots of love from Denmark.",0,0

DnwLS7PYGGQ,UC80yS7U4UqL0VOeovA5FrDw,Kimchi Love,2021-12-04 05:29:58,"Anxiety is FEAR.
Every single thought will eventually break down and lead back to the core feeling of FEAR.
** example **
I feel bad. I have a cough. 
FEAR starts.
So I have the dreaded virus? If I have the virus, does my child?
Who will care for my child? What if I have to be hospitalised? 
So with all these thoughts we can add to the thought *IF this happens THEN WHAT?*
Ultimately the fear is of dying- me or a child or husband or loved one - then being alone or leaving someone else alone for me.
But the core feeling is always fear of something.
Most of mine end with death or alone. Or same for a loved one.
Once I know the fear it helps to start addressing it.
And for me- I had to one day stop and decide to face it. 
Everything I‚Äôd ever done before was an attempt to calm myself and avoid feeling it I realised. 
I stopped and decided to face it down. I literally talked to it and screamed things like I was in battle and I was .....for my life back.
I said things like BRING IT ON!!!! I cursed it and let it know it will not win me over and I won‚Äôt live this way ANYMORE!

It might help to just start with the IF/THEN concept. Take each thought and add IF that happens THEN.....
The goal being to get to the core fear.
Then work on why that is dominating me.
It also helps for me to break down these further into rational versus irrational. 
Sometimes we get so deep into anxiety that we begin to fear anxiety and panic more than the initial reason we started having it.
So we get stuck.
I hope this may help someone.",0,0

Postpartum Anxiety (Rage and a plethora of other fun mommy things) is totally a thing. Your brain changes in pregnancy and wires it to make you sensitive to 'dangers' for your baby for two years (even more), which is why you're probably experiencing more anxiety. It is not an easy transition so don't be too hard on yourself since it is a period of change and growth that happens during matrescence. Sending you lots of love.",1,0

I used the one you're using in the video for my first, but for my second, I upgraded to the Haakaa Ladybug Silicone Milk Collector, which was a game changer for me. It is like the Haakaa you're using, but it doesn't have suction. Instead, you slip it into your nursing bra and it collects leaked milk without spills or the Haakaa popping off (as it sometimes does). Since you can put it in your shirt, it's very discreet if you're breastfeeding while friends and family are around or if you're out.",0,0

My baby just turned 3 months and my hubby and I have been getting a full nights sleep thanks to  this schedule I picked up from the book Moms on Call.

For 8-16 weeks baby
5 am feed
6:30 am 1 hour half nap 
8 am Feed then play
9:30 am 1 hours and half nap
11 am feed then play
12: 30 am 1 hours and half nap
2pm feed them play
3:30 pm 1 hours and half nap
5 pm feed then play
6:30 cat nap 45-1hr nap
7: 30 pm bath time routine 
8:00 pm bedtime feeding then play 
8: 30 put crib

Literal lifesaver the first couple of nights the baby will fuss a little bit but you have to let him cry it out and put himself to sleep. The fox say so you can rub his belly to see him but do not pick him up from the crib.  After that he will love sleeping in his own crib all night with this new schedule üòä",1,0

Children who are breast fed are I think something like 70% less likely to need braces than children who are bottle fed. It's REALLY important for jaw development (the forces on the baby's jaws when they are breast feeding are important). 


Braces may not seem like a big deal but on the extreme end, some people need jaw surgery because they have improper jaw alignment which can even cause severe sleep apnea (no matter the age). I wasn't sure if you did but it's something that should be more well known about in American culture",0,0

The more you feed/pump, the more milk your body will make. Fenugreek and mother's milk can help, if you need a boost. If you decide to stop breastfeeding please do it slowly or there will be a lot of pain in your breasts. They have attachments for the spectra pump so you can use the dr browns bottle and pump right into them, which makes it easier. Congrats, he's gorgeous. üíñ",0,0

I was a young mom (20 when I had her) and I didn‚Äôt have the guidance to do so. I really struggled physically. It took me about 6 months to recover. 

I then was a surrogate at age 22 and again felt the affects of not taking care of myself, mentally. 

Now at 25, I‚Äôm currently pregnant with my 2nd biological child. After watching your postpartum meals & now your current videos I am really inspired to put myself first. 

I wish we could bring back ‚Äúit takes a village‚Äù‚Ä¶ 
I feel people in everyday life have forgotten these ways.

But I‚Äôm finding that it doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask for help even though it is not a common practice in these modern times! 

And when my daughter becomes a mother someday (if she wishes) I will be there for her. ü•∞

I've learned since becoming one, that it's not.  The worst is to be married or in a relationship with the other parent and not have their support.  I'd rather do it alone everyday of the week in that case because the energy of arguing over who's not pulling their weight is a complete waste.  Anyway, as a single mom, I have created incredibly efficient systems that make my life very easy.  I waited until I had an established career before becoming a parent so finances aren't an issue and I also chose a career that allowed me to work virtually so I'm able to be present and take care of everything financially.  My son is well rounded, happy and grateful for the life he has.  As am I.  All the best to you mamas out there.  Like Jenn said, give yourself grace.  It's a tough job but you're made for it!

As a single mother of a 3 year old, I can for sure tell you that the newborn stage is the most tedious.

Baby will eventually go longer without eating and sleep longer and around 4/5 months once dr says it's okay to sleep train, you can you will be well into a routine. I feel like baby's sleep no matter if sleep trained or not is ebb and flow. It is not constant. Just like motherhood. Between growth spurts, developmental leaps (download Wonder Years app), teething, sleep regressions, and sickness, all those play a part in your baby's routine. Hang in there.

By then, some things will just click and fall into place. You have walks, baby nap time/parent productive time, nursing time, breakfast/snacks/lunch/snacks/dinner, and even that time before bed! A moment before sleeping, a time to journal out your day or perhaps your ever changing emotions.",0,0

The first Shi‚Äôa ùóúmam (Commander of the Faithful) Ali (peace be upon him) said: ‚ÄúPeople are the enemies of what they are ignorant of‚Äù so, i hope you take this message seriously. I‚Äôm saying this because I really want what‚Äôs best for you, this is from the heart. The 5th Shi‚Äôa  Imam Abu Ja'far (The Opener of Knowledge) (peace be upon him) said: 'Do not quarrel with the people, for if the people were able to love us, they would have loved us. The 8th imam Ali Son of Musa Al-Reza (the pleasing) (peace be upon him) said: 'May Allah' have Mercy on a servant who revives our matter'. So, Someone said to him 'And how does one revive your matter?'He  said: He would learn our knowledge, and teach it to the people. So if the people were to know the excellence of our speech, they would follow us. The 6th imam Ja'far Son of Muhammad (the honest) (peace be upon him) had been asked about the Words of the Exalted: Say: For Allah is the conclusive Proof [6:149], so he said: 'Allah the Exalted would be Saying to the servant on the Day of Judgment: ""My servant! Were you  a  scholar?"" So if he says, Yes'. He would Say to him: ""So why didn't you act with what you knew?"" And if he says, ""I was ignorant', He would Say to him: ""So why didn't you learn until you could act?"" This is how He (Allah) would Contend with him. This is the conclusive proof. Why I‚Äôm telling you all of this you may ask? It‚Äôs because I want you to support the Lady of heaven movie that depects the story of Lady Fatima the daughter of prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him and his progeny) and her suffering and standing up for herself in the face of evil. What happened to her is the origin of the day of torment for the people of the household (peace be upon them all) whether by doing a reaction to the Trailer or attending the AMC theaters on December 10 , 2021 in the US to watch it early or spreading the word using your social media platforms or all of the above ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",0,0

A great example is that a person WITH autism would be like a person with a purse, or a hat. They can put it down, separate it from themselves. You can‚Äôt do that with autism. It‚Äôs who they are; how their brains are wired.

It may likely appear and feel different than pre-baby, and that itself may take extra time. With our first baby it was when she began a sleep schedule.

Routines are everchanging as you grow, hormones stabilize, baby grows, etc. Every mom deals with different struggles so it was hard for me to find the ""light at the end of the tunnel"". Having a one-on-one chat with a mom does help, though. Just to talk about it helps. Even just you posting about what you're going through allows you to just get it out of your system. Sometimes that's all you need; verbalizing it. No answers needed, just talking out loud. It does get better. I think not that raising the baby gets easier. It's just you and your partner just start trusting yourselves more and being more confident. Learning who you are and what you're made of, that's what having a baby does. You've got this.

X1e_CNNfHP4,UCFfi3hUBLZeCfywMuYjaKjQ,hanamik,2021-11-05 18:39:19,"I really relate to what you said about changing as a mother becoming less type A and more flexible. Kids really stretch you out to experience more and experience better in the moment and on the fly, it‚Äôs pretty amazing. I‚Äôve grown so much as a human from those everyday challenges to slow down and be free in my day. 

I have five kids and I‚Äôm just a year out from my fifth baby, but in my early 30s. Rather than routine, I prefer the word rhythm. We have a rhythm to our day, filled with what needs to be done but not a specific time it needs to be done in and that helps us to be flexible, especially with homeschooling and having so many kids/baby. Babies‚Äô needs and schedules change so often in the first year and as I‚Äôve had more children I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôve not forced myself or my baby to follow a strict schedule. We nurse when baby is hungry, we nap when baby is showing signs of tiredness or falls asleep in the carrier, we work around baby‚Äôs needs which are all do-able in a baby carrier and they sleep longer, have easier access to breastfeed as I‚Äôm getting work done and taking care of other kids. It is easier now as nursing and naps happen less often after a year, it will probably be easier for you once you understand how long Lennon can go between naps to fit things into those periods, even when you‚Äôre alone. The sacrifice of certain routines we held previously are WORTH IT for the new rhythms we practice together. SO worth it. It‚Äôs that round trip thing you mentioned!

I‚Äôm so glad you have your mom to help you and that you‚Äôre taking care of yourself so well mentally and physically in the fourth trimester. You prepared well, now enjoy your baby to the fullest as you already are! These days are long but months/years are so very short.",30,1

I hope you continue to give yourself grace and love because motherhood is hard!

As for the routine, when my little one was an infant they somewhat got into a routine at around 5 months, which was when we accepted sleep training isn't for us so we opted for safe bedsharing (cleared by the pediatrician). Now that my little one is a toddler, there's definitely a more set routine. However, the biggest thing that helped put everything into perspective when the days were hard, was when I came to terms with ""good enough"" parenting as my therapist calls it. I don't need to be a superstar mom. I don't need to spend every second cleaning, teaching my kid, reading to my kid, obsessing over their routine all while working FT without giving myself a break.

As a mother of 2 with little help, I was desperately searching for routine because I feel like it would help me make sense of everything. Order in chaos. In truth, every child is different and they are going through transitions just like you. Every 6 months or so, their routine will change. They will start sleeping longer at night at 6 month old, then God forbid they get sick, and boom, sleep pattern needs to be re-established. 
Just take it month-by-month, and read about their developmental milestones is what helps me the most. When they are teething, when they recognize faces and etc. This is the slowest and fastest journey rolled into one. Just enjoy the journey!

I have a 2 year old and it‚Äôs hard to say when I got back into a routine because our babies will always be changing, especially their sleep schedules and personalities. The moment you feel like you‚Äôve got a routine down, it completely changes the following week or month and you‚Äôre back to figuring out what works for you, baby, and your partner. What helped me is accepting that i may never have my routine back & instead, learning that life is just about adapting. As long as I can incorporate some semblance of me-time in the day through journaling, meditating, moving, it helps, even if it‚Äôs not a routine & like you said, always give yourself compassion bc parenting is difficult and NO ONE has it figured out, we all learn along the way & enjoy the moments as much as we can bc they will never be this little again.

X1e_CNNfHP4,UC3KXZkQ-BeoGnak35RHKkzA,Dorothy LeRay,2021-11-05 17:20:51,"Hi Jenn, since you asked and I am a mom of 2 (you liked my comment on another video of yours), I would say you start to establish a routine around the 12 week mark.  That is when your physical recovery is mostly complete (although if you exclusively or mostly breastfeed, you may not get your period until you stop), and you start thinking about how you can't go on like this, sleeping randomly throughout the day and night.  That's also when you start freaking out because some other moms are saying their babies already sleep through the night.  I don't recommend freaking out, but you can start establishing gentle routines and good habits like a bedtime routine, keeping it dark at night even for wakeups and feeds, getting your baby to feed longer during the day and shorter during the night, not necessarily changing every diaper at night to get them back to sleep faster, getting the baby sufficient sunlight during the day to establish their circadian rhythms.  We ended up sleeping training my first around 5 months with a CIO (cry it out) method, whereas never had to for my second because she naturally was more amenable to sleeping without a ton of help at night.  There's always something new though with parenting.  Once you've got the sleep down (kind of--it can take years for some kids), then there's solid foods, sitting, crawling and other milestones, baby proofing, self feeding, potty training, school research.  Haha, the fun never ends!  :)",0,1
